The characteristics of an assembler, a compiler and an interpreter
  
Compiler
Interpreter
Description:
a program that converts instructions into a machine-code or lower-level form so that they can be read and executed by a computer.
In computer science, an interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled in


Feature:
A compiler is a computer program which helps you transform source code written in a high-level language into low-level machine language


An interpreter does not generate an intermediate machine code
